            <p class="text-dark mb-3" style="font-weight: 450;font-size: 1.15rem;">Hey, my name is Matt I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineer from Cape Town, South Africa!</p>
            <p class="text-dark mb-3" style="font-weight: 450;font-size: 1.15rem;">Being a curious kid, I loved exploring the mysteries of Ancient Egypt and learning all I could about
                those burning balls of gas in the sky. Curioisity drove my passion for learning, while my father's bakground as a radar technician fostered enthusiasm for building and tinkering.
                This ultimately led me down the path to <b>Engineering</b> and in July 2021 I was awarded a BSc. Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Cape Town (UCT) with first class honours.

            </p>
            <p class="text-dark mb-3" style="font-weight: 450;font-size: 1.15rem;">Through my time in engineering I have developed a sense of responsibility to apply my skills in the South African context and
                    have heeded the opportunity to take part in many projects lead by Engineers Without Borders UCT. These include
                    the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3ALg94Hlw2/">Mama Africa</a>
                    and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1TJPL4Hu8J/">Playing with Solar </a> projects. I have also
                    been involved in the development of
                    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixilate&hl=en_us ">Pixilate</a>, a mobile
                    application focused on using Computer Vision to provide
                    translations from English textbooks to African languages.  
            </p>
            <p class="text-dark mb-3" style="font-weight: 450;font-size: 1.15rem;"> 
                Aside from my professional experience in Flutter development and full-stack development, I have a keen interest for simple CAD design, 3D printing, embedded electronics, and robotics. 
                I am further persuing these interests through a Masters in Embedded Systems Engineering with a focus on Control Systems at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
