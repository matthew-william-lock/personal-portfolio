                    <p>My name is <b>Matthew Lock</b> and I am a final year Electrical and Computer Engineering <b>student</b> from Cape Town.</p> 

                    <br>

                    <p>Being a curious kid, I loved exploring the mysteries of Ancient Egypt and learning all I could about those burning balls of gas in the sky. 
                        Curioisity drove my passion for building things with my hands and from an early age I started using Python programming to solve simple challenges.
                        This ultimately led me down my path to <b>Engineering</b> of which I am currently in hot pursuit ðŸ”¥ 
                    </p>  

                    <br>

                    <p>Through my time in engineering I have developed a sense of responsibility to apply my skills in an <b>African context</b>. 
                    I have heeded the opportunity to take part in projects lead by <b>Engineers Without Borders</b> such as the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3ALg94Hlw2/">Mama Africa</a>  
                    and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1TJPL4Hu8J/">Playing with Solar </a> projects. I have also been involved in the development of
                    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixilate&hl=en_us ">Pixilate</a>, an application focused on using Computer Vision to provide 
                    translations from English textbooks to African languages. I am currently involved with the development of an application which aims to strengthen the second hand
